The game is always winnable

A random player won about **24%** of the games. It was suprising to me as I didnt expect it to take 1/2/3 steps in correct order. But as there are multiple ways of winning the same game as from 9 to 5 we can go via -1/-3, -2/-2 and -3/-1 this helps random play to win so much.
